Annotate:

This was my second project at Coding Dojo. It is built using Ruby on Rails with a MySQL database. Youtube Player and Data
APIs were used in order to successfully integrate a youtube search function as well as embed a youtube video player. 

Annotate allows users to watch youtube videos and take notes while they watch. Notes are saved with a given timestamp, and 
automatically load upon replay of the video.
